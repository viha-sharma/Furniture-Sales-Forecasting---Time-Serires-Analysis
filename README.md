### ◈Problem Statement

Every business aims to estimate future trends of their key performing indicators such as sales, profits, gains etc. The idea behind this is to find out the popularity of a certain product and how its sales can impact the business.

Every product category is unique and caters to different customer bases. A thorough insight into the past performance will reveal a lot of components that will enable the business to identify the trends. 

Build a forecast model to predict the furniture sales of a store.

### ◈My Approach

As this is a forecasting problem, I will be utilising time series analysis models such as ARMA, SARIMA and SARIMAX to forecast future furniture sales from 2018 to 2022. Additionally, I will resample the data by Changing the time frequency to monthly data, in order to get a clearer visual of the forecasts.
